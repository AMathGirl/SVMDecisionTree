# An SVM-cum-Decision tree approach to binary classification.
Two-week project involving implementation of a hybrid support vector machine based decision
tree for binary classification in MATLAB. The tree first classified the points as far off or close to
the decision boundary, and then SVM was used only for the latter points to speed up the process.
Worked with Kalpna Gupta.
